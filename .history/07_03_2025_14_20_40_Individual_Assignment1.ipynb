    "- Internships (Float/Double) - It tells the number of internships a student has done.\n",

    "- Workshops/Certifications (Integer) - As there are multiple courses available online student opt for them to upskill themselves.\n",
    "- ApptitudeTestScore (Integer) - Aptitude test are generally a part of the recruitment process to understand the Quant and logical thinking of the student.\n",
    "- SoftSkillrating (Float/Double) - Communication is a key role that plays in the placement or in any aspect of the life.\n",
    "- ExtraCurricularActivities (Character) - This helps provide and insight about the personality of an individual regarding how much he is active other than the academic.\n",
    "- PlacementTraining (Character) - It is provided to students in college to ace the placement process.\n",
    "- SSC and HSC (Integer) - Senior Secondary and Higher Secondary Marks.\n",

    "### (2) Question\n",
    "a) `Quesiton` What factors influence whether a student gets placed in a job or not? \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we aim to analyze how all other variables in the dataset except StudentID impact the probability of a student being placed. We'll not use StudentID as an explanatory variable because it is merely a unique identifier for each student and does not carry any meaningful information about their placement status. \n",
    "\n",
    "The response variable (PlacementStatus) is categorical (Placed/Not Placed), so we'll use logistic regression model in later process.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) This question is focused on both inference and prediction. The inference aspect helps identify which factors significantly contribute to job placement, while the prediction aspect allows us to estimate the likelihood of a student being placed based on their academic and extracurricular profile."
